# Project Diary
## 2026-01-19 — 22:07 to 00:14
Started the macropad project.  
Designed the schematic and PCB layout using KiCad, including component placement and routing.

## 2026-01-20 — 10:30 to 14:20
Began designing the macropad case.  
Initially attempted using Tinkercad, which proved unsuitable for this level of precision.  
Switched to Fusion 360 Personal and modeled the bottom case after a significant learning curve.

## 2026-01-20 — 14:30 to 16:30
Completed the top plate design for the case.  
The overall enclosure is now fully modeled and ready for export and manufacturing.

## 2026-01-20 — 17:40 to 18:20
Developed the initial firmware using KMK and CircuitPython.  
Configured pin mapping and created macros focused on competitive programming workflows.

## 2026-01-23 — 13:00 to 16:31  
I decided to change the original idea: instead of just a macropad, it would become a macropad that also works as an oscilloscope. Since this is an instrument I use a lot in my technical course, I thought, why not build my own?  
During this period, I made several adjustments to the schematic.

I finished the schematic and related work, but then realized that the project had stopped being a macropad :/  
So I decided to start over from scratch. I’ll come back to the oscilloscope project later.

I rebuilt the project from the ground up.  
At this point, everything is back on track, and now I just need to fix and refine the Fusion 360 design.

## 2026-01-24 — 10:00 to 14:00  
I fixed the Fusion 360 model and updated the case design.
